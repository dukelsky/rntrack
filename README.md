==================================

Disclaimer
----------

I don't support RNTrack any more. This repository is here just to preserve history.

What is this program for
------------------------

It is a so-called netmail tracker. Its purpose is to process netmail on
netmail hubs, though it can be helpful for an ordinary node. It parses PKTs
or message bases, compares messages with patterns, and does a specified
action if a message matches the pattern. With some limitations, you may also
use RNTrack for echomail.

Features
--------

* Support for popular message bases: OPUS (*.msg), JAM, Squish.
* Support for PKT 2+.
* Embedded Perl (if scripting is enabled at compile time).
* External templates.
* Portability.
